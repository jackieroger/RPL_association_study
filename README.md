Our study utilized electronic health record (EHR) data that was standardized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. To replicate this study using another OMOP EHR database, follow the query instructions below and then use the code in these R markdown scripts to filter your patients, aggregate diagnoses, implement analyses, analyze results, and create figures.

Query instructions:
1. Query your OMOP database to identify patients that meet the initial inclusion criteria for the RPL group. The initial RPL criteria is: any record of pregnancy loss (as defined in the pregnancy loss, recurrent pregnancy loss, and history of pregnancy loss sections of Supplementary File 1).
2. Query your OMOP database to identify patients that meet the initial inclusion criteria for the Control group. The initial Control criteria is: any record of live-birth (as defined in the live-birth section of Supplementary File 1).
3. Query the included RPL and Control patients' subsets of the following OMOP tables: person, condition_occurrence, observation, procedure_occurrence, and visit_occurrence.
4. The inputs for Rmd 01 are: the table subsets from #3, the OMOP concept table, and the concept lists in Supplementary File 1.

System requirements: This code was developed and tested using R version 4.0.2 on the macOS Monterey version 12.6.3. Diagnosis aggregation used Phecodes version 1.2, and the mapping files can be downloaded from their website: https://phewascatalog.org/phecodes

Installation guide: To run the code, clone this repository. Cloning typically takes a minute or less.

The data used for our project (UCSF and Stanford EHR) is not publically available. UCSF-affiliated individuals can request access to UCSF EHR data by contacting UCSF Information Commons (Info.Commons@ucsf.edu). Stanfordâ€™s EHR data is managed through the Stanford Research Repository (https://med.stanford.edu/starr-tools.html). Individuals not affiliated with UCSF may request to set up an official collaboration with a UCSF-affiliated investigator by contacting the principal investigator, Marina Sirota (marina.sirota@ucsf.edu). Requests should be processed within a couple of weeks.
